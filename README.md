# Mastodon-Simulator Project

Initially developed to benchmark [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon-sc/)’s data handling capabilities and
challenge its theoretical limits, a simulator for a growing cell population was implemented directly within Mastodon,
and is openly available here.

The simulator is technically an agent-based system in 3D Cartesian space, where agents are defined
as rigid spheres with varying radii and fixed mass.

*More details and illustrations TBA...*
